Faster you go the more upward force (lift)
If you tilt the wings the air will create an upward force when the bounce off the wing

Rutter (mid back blade) controls yaw
Elevator (back 2 blades) control pitch
Ailerons control roll

When the plane tips the force direction created by the wings changes this allows the plane to turn. This also decreases the component of the lift pointing upwards

If the force of lift is > than the force of gravity the airplane elevation increases

There is a certain angle which will give max lift, if increased past the angle the lift will decrease (Stall)

Incoming airflow can be altered by change in speed

To lower altitude reduce thrust, slow down, and lift will decrease resulting in a larger net downward force

Land in the wind as to shorten the amount of runway necessary
Good to take off at the wind to increase airflow over the wings, increasing lift

Drag

Once airborne, velocity of the plane is determined by the velocity of the plane relative to the surrounding air + velocity of the wind.
